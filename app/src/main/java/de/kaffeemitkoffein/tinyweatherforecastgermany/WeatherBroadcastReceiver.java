/*

 This is a simple BroadcastReceiver to demonstrate how weather data from this app can be included
 in the Gadgetbridge app. It is not used in this app.

 You need to put this receiver in AndroidManifest.xml:

 <receiver android:name=".WeatherBroadcastReceiver"
           android:exported="true">
     <intent-filter>
          <action android:name="de.kaffeemitkoffein.broadcast.WEATHERDATA"/>
     </intent-filter>
 </receiver>

 To manually trigger a weather update FROM gadgetbridge, do a broadcast with the following action:

 public final static String UPDATE_ACTION = "de.kaffeemitkoffein.broadcast.REQUEST_UPDATE";
 ...
 Intent intent = new Intent();
 intent.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_INCLUDE_STOPPED_PACKAGES);
 intent.setPackage("de.kaffeemitkoffein.tinyweatherforecastgermany");
 intent.setAction(UPDATE_ACTION);
 sendBroadcast(intent);
 ...

 Anyway, this app - once enabled by the user - will send every weather update to Gadgetbridge.

public class WeatherBroadcastReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {

    public final static String WEATHER_EXTRA="WeatherSpec";

    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        if (intent != null){
            Bundle bundle = intent.getExtras();
            if (bundle != null){
                WeatherSpec weatherSpec = bundle.getParcelable(WEATHER_EXTRA);
                if (weatherSpec != null){
                    /*
                     * display the weather data on a wearable
                     */

    }
