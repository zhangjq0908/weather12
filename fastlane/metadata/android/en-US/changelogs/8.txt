Version 0.50:
- added DWD weather warnings
- added scaled weather icon and symbol sets to improve performance
- added better support for wide screens
- added an introduction screen explaining the main app features
- fixed broken garbage collector for old forecast data
- fixed application sometimes installing on SD-card, making widgets not accessible
- fixed minor bug making the app crash when settings are called too early on 1st app launch

Gadgetbridge support:
- changed timestamp in Gadgetbridge API from polling time to forecast time; this should solve the issue of some wearables complaining about missing weather info
- added setting to set the timestamp of the current weather forecast to the current time instead of the forecast time, as some wearables do not accept a forecast as current weather
- fixed gadgetbridge last update time unknown at first app launch
- fixed wearables not displaying weather condition text properly
