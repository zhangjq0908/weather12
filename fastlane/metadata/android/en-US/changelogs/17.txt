- added feature to find closest weather sensors by geo-coordinates or location services on the device
- added fallback to http without ssl, if an encrypted connection fails on very old devices (e.g. 4.x.x) due to missing cipher-suites
- incomplete time intervals (6h, 24h) now discard past data in calculations where possible
- fixed error in calculation of min. and max. temperatures (might have been too high & too low)
- multiple minor bugfixes
